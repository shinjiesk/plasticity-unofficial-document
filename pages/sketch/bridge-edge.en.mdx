<Reference shortcut="" command="Bridge Edge" button="" />

Bridges two Edges that can be G0/G1/G2/G3 continuous. Specify which end of the Edges to bridge. Tension is adjustable.

## Basic Usage

1. Select two Edges you want to bridge.
2. Use the **Bridge** command in the Command Palette
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog and Keyboard Shortcuts.
     - <Kst>Command Dialog</Kst>
          - **Side:** 
          - **Side 1:** Specify which side of the endpoint of the initially selected Edge to bridge to.
          - **Side 2:** Specify which side of the endpoint of the subsequently selected Edge to bridge to.
          - **Tension 1:**
               - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 1st Control-Vertex(CV) to 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
          - **Tension 2:**
               - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 2nd CV and 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
          - **Tension 3:**
               - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
          - **Start curvature:**
               - **G0, G1, G2, G3:** Specify the [continuity of the  Curve](/cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface) at the starting point.
          -  **End curvature:**
               - **G0, G1, G2, G3:** Specify the [continuity of the  Curve](/cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface) at the ending point.      
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
