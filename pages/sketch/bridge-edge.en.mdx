2. Use the **Bridge** command in the Command Palette
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog and Keyboard Shortcuts.
   - **Side:** 
        - **Side 1:** Specify which side of the endpoint of the initially selected Edge to bridge to.
        - **Side 2:** Specify which side of the endpoint of the subsequently selected Edge to bridge to.
     - **T:**
          - **Value 1/2:** The relative position on the segment of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Direction:** 
          - **Direction 1/2:** Reverse the direction of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Tension 1:**
          - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 1st CV to 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Tension 2:**
          - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 2nd CV and 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Tension 3:**
          - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Start curvature:**
          - **G0, G1, G2, G3:** Specify the [continuity of the  Curve](../cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface) at the starting point.
     -  **End curvature:**
          - **G0, G1, G2, G3:** Specify the [continuity of the  Curve](../cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface) at the ending point.
