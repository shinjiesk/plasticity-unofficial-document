# Bridge

<Reference shortcut="" command="Bridge" button="" />

This command automatically calls the following command depending on the selected object.
     - When two Curves are selected or nothing is selected: see [**Bridge Curve**](#bridge-curve) described below.
     - When two Vertices are selected: see [**Bridge Vertex**](#bridge-vertex) described below.
     - When two Edges are selected: see [**Bridge Edge**](#bridge-edge) described below.

## Bridge Curve[#bridge-curve]

You can connect two curves while considering continuity. Additionally, you can connect them at any point on the edge, face, or construction plane.

<Callout emoji="❗">
    **Note**<br />
Before selecting a point, enable [**Grid Snaps**](../3d-viewport/grid-and-snap#grid-snap) and [**Object Snaps**](../3d-viewport/grid-and-snap#object-snap).
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
The starting and ending points can be selected at any point on the curve, edge, face, or construction plane.
</Callout>

1. Click the button <ButtonIcon type="button-bridge-curve" /> on the Toolbar.
2. Click on the starting point
   - <kbd>X</kbd>/ <kbd>Y</kbd>/<kbd>Z</kbd> **X/Y/Z-axis:** [Constrain to the X, Y, or Z-axis](./sketching-essentials#constrain-to-an-axis).
   - <kbd>N</kbd> **Normal** Limit to the Face's normal direction.  
3. Click on the ending point.  
4. Set the options in the Command Dialog and Keyboard Shortcuts.
     - **T:**
          - **Value 1/2:** The relative position on the segment of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Direction:** 
          - **Direction 1/2:** Reverse the direction of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Tension 1:**
          - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 1st CV to 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Tension 2:**
          - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 2nd CV and 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Tension 3:**
          - **Value 1/2:** The tension value affected 3rd CV of the starting point/ending point.
     - **Start curvature:**
          - **G0, G1, G2, G3:** Specify the [continuity of the curve](../cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface) at the starting point.
     -  **End curvature:**
          - **G0, G1, G2, G3:** Specify the [continuity of the curve](../cad-essentials/continuity-curve-and-surface) at the ending point.      
   - **Trim:** When turned on, any curve that extends beyond the bridge will be trimmed.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

## Bridge Vertex[#bridge-vertex]

Two vertices can be connected for continuity.

1. Select two Vertices you want to bridge.
2. Use the **Bridge**  command in the Command Palette.
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog and Keyboard Shortcuts. 
     - Options are the same as [**Bridge Curve**](#bridge-curve) described above.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

## Bridge Edge[#bridge-edge]

Two edges can be connected for continuity.

1. Select two Edges you want to bridge.
2. Use the **Bridge** command in the Command Palette
3. Set the options in the Command Dialog and Keyboard Shortcuts.
   - **Side:** 
        - **Side 1:** Specify which side of the endpoint of the initially selected edge to bridge to.
        - **Side 2:** Specify which side of the endpoint of the subsequently selected edge to bridge to.
     - Anothe options are the same as [**Bridge Curve**](#bridge-curve) described above.
4. Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
